# Task Manager

### Purpose
This project was given to me by Turing School of Software. It is a very small app that holds tasks and allows a user to add, create, edit and delete these tasks. The main takeaway on this project was simply the repition I received from it. While learning my way around Rails, I heard from many people that repetition at first was important, and that's what it did for me.
